PrimeNaloga
PrimeNaloga is a Python-based web application designed to help users compute and visualize prime numbers efficiently. It allows users to input a range of numbers and receive a list of prime numbers within that range. The application is built using the Flask web framework and is optimized for performance and usability.

Features
Prime Number Computation: Compute prime numbers within a specified range.
Visualization: Graphical representation of prime numbers.
Performance: Efficient algorithms for prime number calculation.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive UI built with HTML/CSS and Flask.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the PrimeNaloga project locally:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DoliTim/primeNaloga.git
cd primeNaloga
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the application.

Usage
Enter the desired range of numbers in the input field.
Click on the "Compute Primes" button to generate and display the prime numbers within the given range.
Use the visualization tool to see a graphical representation of the computed primes.
